# Caesar Cipher Decrypter
A proof of concept for performing cracking an encoded message (encoded with Caesar's Cipher) using Python.

## Description
This project demonstrates the brute force cracking method overlayed with multiple filters (e.g. 'langdetect') in order to minimise the user's need for intervention into the list of potentially decrypted messages.
Using this implementation, the program manages to output strightforward the clear-text-message.

## Getting Started
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Required Dependencies**:
    - 'langdetect' - `pip install langdetect` or `pip3 install langdetect`;
    - 're' - should be preinstalled as it is part of the standard Python library;

3. **Run the program**: `python caesar-cipher-decrypter` or `python3 caesar-cipher-decrypter`.
